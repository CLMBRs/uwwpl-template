# UW Working Papers in Linguistics LaTeX Template

This repo contains a LaTeX template for writing papers conforming to the style guidelines of UW Working Papers in Linguistics.  You should be able to simply download a copy of this repo (e.g. by clicking the green `Code` button in the GitHub interface) and start editing `main.tex`!

If you run into any issues or find things that need to be changed, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request on this repo (or send an email to shanest@uw.edu).

A few quick notes:
* The `unified` files are due to Kai von Fintel's work on implementing the Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics Journals at _Semantics & Pragmatics_.  You can see the original sources for those files here: https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified
* This presumes the use of `biblatex` instead of `bibtex`.  While the former tends to be better, the main reason for adopting it for this template is because of the aforementioned templates.  If you know of an easy way of using bibtex with the unified style, please do let us know!
* To add references, fill in the `addbibresource` command in the header with a pointer to one or more `.bib` files.
